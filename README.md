This is the working repository for the Elfun Greater Cincinnati Elfun Non-Profit Social Organization Supporting Current and Former GE Employees

Elfun Greater Cincinnati, a 501c(7) organization, strives to connect its members network by providing events and benefits.  During the COVID-19 pandemic we will to continue to engage our members providing valued benefits. We will organize events as guidelines allow us and take this time to reflect on the past, and plan for the present and work for a strong future for our organization to benefit our members.

We will be working to provide member events and benefits while transitioning along with changes in our world. We recognize there are many situations people encounter that may not make particular events advantageous for them, but we will strive to deliver a variety of values to our members.

As the new board transitions into place and works to establish the plan for the year we encourage our members to actively contact board members and participate in planning and leading events to grow the ElfunGC community.

We want to continue as Elfun has done historically by participating in community service and social events by supporting with volunteers.

Dues have remained low and we will continue at $25 annually; due each January. Please request to be added to the payroll deduction by sending an email to elfungc@gmail.com requesting for automatic deduction.
